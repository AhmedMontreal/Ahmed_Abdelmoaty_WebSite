    summary: |
      I studied the advanced concepts of game theory and its practical applications. By the end, I was well-versed in significant topics such as social choice, mechanism design, efficient mechanisms, and auctions. I gained insights into designing interactions between agents to achieve optimal social outcomes, understood the complexities of collective decision-making, and learned to implement various auction models. This course equipped me with the skills to apply game theory principles to real-world scenarios and strategic decision-making processes.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
